## Query Batches in Interactive Manner
We also conducted an interactive experiment where we asked 8 volunteers to used an interactive lifelog retrieval system (with 2 different backend search engines: concept-based and embedding-based) to solve LSC'21 queries. We divided queries into 4 smaller query batches (6 queries / batch), each volunteer used system with each search engine to solve 1 batch (2 batch / user in total).

The interactive system we used was [E-MyScéal](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3512729.3533012). The backend were concept-based [MyScéal 2.0](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3463948.3469064) and embedding-based HADA.
